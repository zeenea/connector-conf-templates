#
# Filter packages that should be keep in the inventory.

#
# Example:
#   filter = "package in ('production-pack01', 'production-pack02')"
#
# Note:
#   Filter can contain either the raw value or a file URL to the content.
#   Example:
#     filter = "file:///path/to/zeenea/connections/ssis-filter.json"
#
# When using an side-file, filter changes are taken into account without restarting the scanner.
