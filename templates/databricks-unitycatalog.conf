# filter keys are:
#   table   : the table name
#   schema  : the schema name
#   catalog : the catalog name
#
# Example:
#   filter = """

#       and (
#              table not contains 'tmp' or schema not contains 'to_delete'

# Note: Filter can contain either the raw value or a file URL to the content. (e.g. file:///path/to/zeenea/connections/databricks-filter.json)
# When using an side-file, filter changes are taken into account without restarting the scanner.
