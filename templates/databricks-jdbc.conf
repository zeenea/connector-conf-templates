# Filter
#
# Filter the documents that should listed through the inventory.
# Use the rich filter language described in documentation.
# https://zeenea-platform-docs.netlify.app/docs/zeenea-filters
#
# filter keys are:
#   catalog  : the catalog name
#   schema  : the schema name
#   table   : the table name
#
# Example:
#   filter = """
#           catalog in ('dev_catalog', 'main')
#       and (
#              table not contains 'tmp' or schema not contains 'to_delete'
#           )
#   """
#
# Note: Filter can contain either the raw value or a file URL to the content. (e.g. file:///path/to/zeenea/connections/databricks-filter.json)
# When using an side-file, filter changes are taken into account without restarting the scanner.
