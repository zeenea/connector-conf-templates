# Filter the relations (tables or views) that should be keep in the inventory.

# https://docs.actian.com/zeenea/#page/Technical%20Documentation/zeenea-filters.html
#
# filter keys are:
#   schema : the schema name.
#   table  : the table or view name.
#
# Example:
#   filter = """
#              schema starts with 'CUSTOM_' and not table ends with '_BAK'
#           or schema ~ 'INTERN_*' and table ~ /(?:HR|IT|MARKET)_FIGURES/
#           or schema = 'MUSIC' and table contains 'ALBUMS' and table != 'OLD_ALBUMS'

#
# Note: Filter can contain either the raw value or a file URL to the content.
# Example:
#   filter = "file:///path/to/zeenea/connections/oracle-filter.json"

# When using an side-file, filter changes are taken into account without restarting the scanner.
