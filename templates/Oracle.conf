# filter keys are:
#   schema : the schema name.
#   table  : the table or view name.
#
# Example:
#   filter = """
#              schema starts with 'CUSTOM_' and not table ends with '_BAK'
#           or schema ~ 'INTERN_*' and table ~ /(?:HR|IT|MARKET)_FIGURES/

# Note: Filter can contain either the raw value or a file URL to the content.
# Example:
