#
# filter keys are:
#   container: the container name.
#   path     : the path of the file in the container.
#
# If there is a file 'https:///example.blob.core.windows.net/cogip_prod_sales/forecasts/europa/france/paris-2023.parquet'.
# The value of associated to 'container' will be 'cogip_prod_sales'.
# The value of associated to 'path' will be 'forecasts/europa/france/paris-2023.parquet'.
#
# Example:
#   filter = """
#           container starts with 'cogip_prod_'
#       and ! (
#              path ~ '*/test*'
#           or path ~ /.*\/secret_assets\/.*/

    # With standard strategy, the file partition pattern define the changing part of a file.
    # The parts of the file name without the extension that match the pattern are replaced by a start to form the sybolic name of the  
    # For instance, if you have the given files:

    # The default value matches:

    # It is typically used when there is a dummy folder in the path.

    # For instance, by skipping the data folder, the following dataset will be identified as "sales" instead of "data":

    # For instance, the "sales" dataset contains a folder "data" and a folder "logs" with data processing logs.
    # For this dataset to be correctly discovered, we need to skip "data" and ignore "logs".
