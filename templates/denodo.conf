# Filter
#
# Filter the relations (tables or views) that should be keep in the inventory.
# Use the rich filter language described in documentation.
# https://docs.actian.com/zeenea/#page/Technical%20Documentation/zeenea-filters.html
#
# filter keys are:
#   serverUrl: the server URL. (Example: '//denodo.example.com:9090/admin')
#   database : the database name.
#   view     : the view name.
#   type     : the view type ('derived', 'interface', 'base')
#
# Example:
#   filter = """
#           database in ('PRODUCTION', 'QA') 
#       and (
#              view starts with 'CUSTOM_' and not view ends with '_BAK'
#           or type in ('derived', 'interface')

# Note: Filter can contain either the raw value or a file URL to the content.
# Example:

# When using an side-file, filter changes are taken into account without restarting the scanner.
