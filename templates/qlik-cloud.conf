# Filter
#
# Filter the applications that should be listed through the inventory.
# Use the rich filter language described in documentation.
# https://docs.actian.com/zeenea/#page/Technical%20Documentation/zeenea-filters.html
#
# filter keys are:
#   name   : the application name
#
# Example:
#   filter = """
#           name not contains 'dev' and name not starts with '_'
#   """
#
# Note: Filter can contain either the raw value or a file URL to the content. (e.g. file:///path/to/zeenea/connections/qlik-filter.json)
# When using an side-file, filter changes are taken into account without restarting the scanner.
