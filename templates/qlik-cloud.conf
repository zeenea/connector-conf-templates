#       French  version: https://support.zeenea.com/hc/fr/articles/21269299175569-Filtres
#
# filter keys are:
#   name   : the application name
#
# Example:
#   filter = """
#           name not contains 'dev' and name not starts with '_'

# Note: Filter can contain either the raw value or a file URL to the content. (e.g. file:///path/to/zeenea/connections/qlik-filter.json)
# When using an side-file, filter changes are taken into account without restarting the scanner.
